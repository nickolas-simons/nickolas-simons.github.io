Hello! I'm Nick, an undergrad student interested in pursuing a career as a software engineer within the games industry. I am most interested in gameplay, tools, and devOps engineering because it allows me to enable other developers to create their vision. With 5+ years using Unreal Engine, a background as a programming lead, and strong foundation in C/C++, I can leverage my skills to develop scalable and maintainable systems. 

If you're interested in what I can offer your company or studio, please contact me!
