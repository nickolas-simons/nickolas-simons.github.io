**Overview:**
A Sci-Fi card battler roguelike with mechanics influenced by **Slay the Spire**, **Magic the Gathering**, and **Yu-Gi-Oh**. Developed in a team of 5 for GSD405, this project continued after the semester ended, evolving into a deeper strategy game with expanded mechanics and a shift to a 2.5D perspective.

**Expanded Features (Post-Transition):**
- **Combat System Expansion:**

- **New Implementations:**  
   - Integrated equipment system and UI scripting.
   - Adjusted player character and combat systems to accommodate the 3D perspective change.
   - Extended the effects system to apply to items and characters.
   - Developed genre-based card mechanics, similar to the land resource system in **Magic the Gathering**.
