**Overview:**
Submission for the 7 day 2025 Epic Megajam. Entered for the 'One Man Army' and 'Use It or Lose It' special modifiers.

**Theme chosen:** "However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light"

**Assets:** Some audio assets come from weloveindies, all other game assets made by me during the jam.

**Development Details:**
   - **Platform/Engine:**  
   Developed on UE5 for PC
   - **Time:**   
   7 days
   - **Team:**   
   Solo

**Notable Features**
- Only a single 512x512 RGBA texture is sampled during the game, using a combination of gradient texturing and procedural or noise based post-processing effects (sampled from the texture) for most shaders.
- Animation for character baked from new locomotor plugin introduced in UE 5.6 (excluding additive layers).
- Fire effects are created using a blend based upon sine of a signed distance field multiplied with the time since burn activation.

**Platform and Engine:**  
   Unreal Engine 5 for PCVR platforms
