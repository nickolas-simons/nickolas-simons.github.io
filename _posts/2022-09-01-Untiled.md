**Overview:**
A solo personal project designed to deepen familiarity with Unreal Engine's testing and replication frameworks. This is a roguelike, third-person isometric action game where the player navigates various environments, battling regional bosses.

**Key Features:**
- **Procedural World Generation:**  
   Implemented a system for randomly generating data-driven tile partitions using constrained probability matrices.
  
- **Network Replication:**  
   Developed a runtime system that replicates the randomly generated environment partitions across all players.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
- **Attack Tracing Combat System:**  
   Created an adjustable attack tracing component to support different weapon types and tracing profiles (e.g., radial, linear, circular attacks).

- **Item Pickup System:**  
   Designed a diegetic item management system where players can hold one item and stash two others.

**Art and Animation:**
- **Character Design & Animation:**  
   Modeled and animated a low-fidelity prototype character to support early gameplay testing and animation iteration.
