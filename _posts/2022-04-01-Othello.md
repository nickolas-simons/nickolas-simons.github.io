**Overview:**
A final project developed for CS340: Programming Patterns and Paradigms, this is an ASCII-based Othello game created in Haskell. It features a computer-controlled opponent and supports variable board sizes.

**Key Features:**
- **Haskell Development:**  
   Designed and implemented the game using Haskell, applying functional programming concepts.
  
- **AI Opponent:**  
   Implemented a computer-controlled opponent using mini-max algorithm on a pruned game tree, allowing for strategic AI gameplay. (i can't beat it anyway so that must mean something)
